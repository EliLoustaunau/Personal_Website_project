# Personal_Website_project

Just a personal website that tracks my progress with implementing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is also practice to get used to Git and GitHub

Just added a tiny bit of CSS to my website the biggest achievement was setting up Git and Github to my Code.
I can now finally add Commits and push code to here. 
This is the beginning since now I can actually save my work and not have to worry about it being lost or what not.
