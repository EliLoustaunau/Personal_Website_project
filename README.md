# Personal_Website_project

9/22/2023
Just a personal website that tracks my progress with implementing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is also practice to get used to Git and GitHub

Just added a tiny bit of CSS to my website the biggest achievement was setting up Git and Github to my Code.
I can now finally add Commits and push code to here. 
This is the beginning since now I can actually save my work and not have to worry about it being lost or whatnot.

It has been a little while since I worked on this project but have been busy with work, school, etc.
A couple of changes I have made were adding font, coloring, alignment, and fixing any eyesores.
I hope to come back on Sunday and add to this project some more while juggling everything else.
